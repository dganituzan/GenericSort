*** Assignment: ***

Writing a program that getting an input: an Integer or a String array. The program will sort them by Heap Sort 

and present the sorted array to the user.

*** Goals ***

Using our new knowledge about generic types by getting one of the two types String and Integer arrays

(according to the user desire) and sort them while using comparable<T> and Heap Sort.

The program will be atractive and capable of doing a variety of input/output arrays sort. 

For instance, an empty array, sorted array, etc.

*** Package ***

GenericSort

*** Classes ***

HeapSort - this class doing the actuall sorting. it builds a heap, doing sift down and swap.

Main - this class include the instructions of this program. this is where the interaction user occurs.

*** Running The Program ***
Navigate to Start -> Run.
Type CMD and press Enter.
Set the path to your JDK bin directory, for example: "set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161\bin".
Navigate to the project's source folder, for example: "cd javaWorkspace/DI2".
Type the command: "javac Main.java".

*** Exit The Program ***

follow the instruction . 
it can be by press the digit '3' or press 'N' when the program asking.

*** Appendix ***
the program will represent a menu. The user need to follow the instructions.

at the start:

press: 1 to sort an integer array.

       2 to sort string array.
       
       3 for exit.
